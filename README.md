# RetroPulse

## About

RetroPulse is an unobtrusive, cross-platform mod/tracker music player built on [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) and [libopenmpt](https://lib.openmpt.org/). The player primarily resides in the menu bar/tray, designed to be completely out of your way. It was envisioned as a background music player for *soothing* retro music, allowing you to stay productive while enjoying your favorite tunes.
